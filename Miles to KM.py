#A simple program to convert miles to kilometres and vice versa
#Currently you can only convert km to miles by doing miles to km first

m = float(input("Input your distance in miles: "))
km = mi*1.609
print("Miles to KM:" , kilom)

print()

kilometres = float(input("Input your distance in KM: "))
miles = km*0.609
print("KM to Miles:" , miles)
